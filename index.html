        <h1>Maria Brink</h1>
        <div class="text">
<ul>
        <li class="maria"> Maria Brink is an American Singer and Song writer,she's best known as the front-woman of the heavy metal band "In This Moment".Brink has been awarded "Rock Goddess of the Year" in 2013 and 2015 Annual Loudwire Music Awards,"Hottest Chick in Metal" in 2010, one of eleven women in heavy metal who matter by Yell! Magazine in 2012, and was recognized by Revolver Magazine as one of the "25 Hottest Chicks in Hard Rock and Metal".</li>
            
           <li class="maria"> Brink was born in the state of New York, and her father left the family when she was young. When she was 14, she got pregnant and at 15, Maria gave birth to her son Davion. During high school, Maria was considered a burn-out (they didn't think she was going to graduate).During her teen years, Maria was severely depressed, even bordering on suicidal. The birth of her son caused her to snap out of her funk. Soon after she had her son, she moved out on her own and got her own apartment. She worked at a local laundromat to help pay the rent. In addition to being a musician, Maria is also a very accomplished painter. She often does custom paintings for her Wonderland site. At one point in her life, Maria’s mother was a drug addict. Maria eventually helped her mother to get checked into rehab and she is now clean.Maria is a self-proclaimed vegetarian and is active with the PETA campaign.
    </li>
<li class="maria"> The first band Brink was ever in was an Albany,New York based band called "Pulse" before moving to California.They opened local shows for bands such as Coal Chamber and Sevendust, but they eventually broke up.In 2002, when she was 25, she moved to Los Angeles to find a band to work with; it took two years to find her now-band member Chris Howorth. Maria loved theater as a young girl, and has since decided to bring that element into their current live shows.
When Maria and Chris first met, he wouldn’t audition her because she was a woman. But upon hearing her sing, he immediately apologized for stereotyping her.
Maria, Chris, and Jeff formed a band called Dying Star soon after her audition, but after only two gigs, they put the kabash on that. The song “Drifting”, which is now considered an In This Moment demo, was actually recorded under the Dying Star band name.
Maria wrote the song “Legacy of Odio” as a tribute to the death of her best friend.
Maria’s on-stage persona is merely a persona. She often refers to it as her “alter ego”. In real life, she’s a self-proclaimed “flower child”.</li>
    <li class="maria">Maria has her very own personal assistant named Avisia. Maria often refers to the both of them as sisters. Avisia has appeared in both the Blood and Adrenalize music videos. During Rock On The Range in 2012, Maria brought her up on stage so that her boyfriend Dan could propose to her in front of the entire crowd. It was also Avisia’s birthday that day. Avisia also helps to run Maria’s fan club, Maria Brink’s Wonderland.</li>

        <div class="albums">
            <h4>Formation and Beautiful Tragedy (2005–2008):</h4>
            <ul>
                <li class="maria">In August 2005, singer Maria Brink and guitarist Chris Howorth met through some common friends. After becoming acquainted, and finding that there was much in common between them, they began writing songs together. Soon thereafter they enlisted the help of Los Angeles drummer Jeff Fabb and formed the band Dying Star. Unhappy with where the band was headed, they decided to take on a new musical direction. By mid-2005, the lineup included Brink, Howorth, Fabb, guitarist Blake Bunzel, and bassist Josh Newell. The band recorded demos and posted them on MySpace. During the winter of 2005, Newell departed from the band to focus on his other musical project, Ketaset, as well as his audio engineering work. Producer Pascual Romero was then the bassist for a time before friend of the band Jesse Landry was eventually tapped to round out the band permanently. Rob "Blasko" Nicholson, the bassist for Ozzy Osbourne became the band's manager after discovering them through MySpace.

By the end of the 2005, In This Moment had generated a fanbase through internet marketing and do-it-yourself touring. This sparked an interest from Century Media Records, and a worldwide record deal followed. The band released their debut album Beautiful Tragedy on March 20, 2007, backed by the singles "Prayers", and title track "Beautiful Tragedy". The album was produced by Eric Rachel and combined sounds of metalcore and hard rock while the lyrics drew from Brink's personal experiences about abandonment and tragedies. The vocals on the songs alternate between Brink singing and screaming. The band performed on several tours including The Hottest Chicks in Metal Tour 2007 with Lacuna Coil, Ozzfest in 2007 and 2008, Megadeth, and the Rob Zombie and Ozzy Osbourne tour. They recorded a cover of Lacuna Coil's "Heaven's a Lie" with the band Manntis as part of "Century Media Records's Covering 20 Years of Extreme cover album.</li>

The song "Forever" was released as the album's lead single. To support the release, the band went on tour with Five Finger Death Punch, Mudvayne, Papa Roach, and Filter.

They also revealed that they were set to enter the studio on February 23 to begin recording their fifth studio album and follow up to Blood. Chris Howorth said, "We have a bunch of ideas and the way we did Blood was different than we'd done any album before. We brought ideas and pieces and parts into the studio and wrote each song in the studio, one at a time. All the other albums we had the songs formatted and together already. So we're going to do the same thing again. We're gonna try to replicate the magic of Blood and try to take the style and sound we had for Blood and just do it bigger and better while still keeping true to that same vibe. That's our sound. We feel like we found something and want to stick the flag in the ground on top of that hill."

The first single, "Sick Like Me" from the band's album, Black Widow was released to digital retailers on September 9, 2014 while the album, produced by Kevin Churko, was released on November 17, 2014.
